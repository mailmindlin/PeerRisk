        	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p style='text-align: justify;'>
				In general, <b>I really don't care about your data.</b> I wrote this app to play a fun board game online with friends, <b>not</b> to steal all your datas
				and be evil in general. This app does collect some personal information for player identification and gameplay niceness (your email (for UUID purposes),
				maybe your name), and also collects some network information (actually, it's a lot of network information; it's for the peer connections). As far as I
				know, none of this information is stored on my end, but some might be stored in a file on <i>your</i> Google Drive. In general, I will try to ensure
				that identifying information is scrambled or something (i.e., applying some hash function). Some information will be transmitted, like what username
				you choose, to <i>other</i> people, but only to the people playing a game with you (they won't be able to get your email or anything else). Even though
				<i>I</i> don't collect your information, other parties (i.e., Google, Apple, Microsoft, the NSA) are probably going to collect something from you using
				my app. I will make this hard for them (HTTPS), but the NSA probably has a quantum computer or something that can decrypt your traffic. I might make
				changes to this policy in the future, because this is a quickly changing app (i.e., I might allow AIs to be trained with data from played games, or if I
				switch from Google Drive to something like Firebase for WebRTC signalling, and I store more data), and I might not tell you before (or at all; I am kindof
				forgetful), but if you check this page every so often, you should be up to date with everything. I don't like people running secret mining operations,
				so I won't be a hypocrite. In addition, I'll probably come out with some tool so that you can see what data has been stored, and who can see it.
