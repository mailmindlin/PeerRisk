==Kindof working...
	Added networking support!
		This now can connect to peers with a server/client event model
		Working on a peer-shared resource setup, with webRTC and/or serviceWorker's
	Temporarily removed rendering:
		I know that I can render stuff, so I temporarily refocused on the infrastructure
	Animations:
		The setup screen(s) are cool now, because I added CSS3 animations to them
	Classes:
		With class.js, I redid many classes to be better extensible.
		TODO: speedtest comparisons
